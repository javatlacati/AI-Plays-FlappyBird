# AI-Plays-FlappyBird
Using genetic algorithm and neural networks to teach AI to play flappy bird. Inspired by [this project](https://github.com/pakoito/MarI-O) and [this paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf). The dashboard in the html page is inspired by [this website](http://rednuht.org/genetic_walkers/).

### TypeScript Version
This TypeScript version of AI Plays FlappyBird is committed mainly by [@javatlacati](https://github.com/javatlacati). Thanks for the nice work!

## Goals
- [x] Make a flappy bird game
- [x] Construct neural networks
- [x] Construct genetic algorithms
- [x] Teach the networks to play flappy bird
- [x] Make the animation more fancy :)
- [x] Make a little controller in the html page
- [ ] ~~Finish the "compete with AI" function~~ Too complicated and will make my code messy (though it is already a mess now). I give up...
